## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React
    *   HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    *   React Router (for routing)
    *   State Management: React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer, Context API). Consider Redux or Zustand only if necessary.
    *   Data Fetching: `fetch` API or `axios`
*   **Backend:**
    *   PHP (Custom API) - No framework, or a microframework like Slim/Lumen if needed.
*   **Database:**
    *   MySQL (Hostinger)
*   **Content Management:**
    *   Custom-built simple CMS (PHP and MySQL, interacting with the React frontend via the API)
*   **Hosting:**
    *   Hostinger Shared Hosting

## Scaling Strategies (within limitations):

*   **Performance Optimization:** Absolutely critical for React on shared hosting.
    *   Efficient Code: Write clean, efficient React and PHP code.
    *   Code Splitting, Virtualization, Memoization (React-specific optimizations).
    *   Caching: Use server-side caching (if available) and client-side caching.
    *   Database Optimization: Regularly optimize the database.
    *   CDN: Use a Content Delivery Network (e.g., Cloudflare).
*   **Feature Limitations:** Avoid resource-intensive features.
*   **Future Migration:** If budget allows, migrating to a VPS or cloud hosting would provide more scalability.

## Workflow

1.  **Local Development:**
    *   Developers set up a local development environment (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP for PHP and MySQL, Node.js for React).
    *   The React frontend and PHP backend are developed locally.
    *   Git is used for version control.

2.  **GitHub Collaboration:**
    *   A central GitHub repository hosts the project code.
    *   Developers push their changes to GitHub and create pull requests.
    *   Code reviews are conducted on pull requests.

3.  **Deployment to Hostinger:**
    *   **Initially (Manual):**
        *   Build the React application for production (`npm run build`).
        *   Upload the contents of the `build` directory (React frontend) to Hostinger via FTP or the File Manager.
        *   Upload the PHP backend files to Hostinger.
        *   Create the MySQL database and import the schema.
    *   **Potentially (Automated):**
        *   Explore using a deployment script or tool to automate deployments from GitHub to Hostinger. This is more complex with a separate frontend and backend.

## Success Metrics

*   Website traffic (using Google Analytics or a similar tool)
*   User engagement (if user accounts and interaction features are implemented)
*   Content growth (amount of content on the site)
*   Website performance (page load time, server response time)
*   User feedback (if a feedback mechanism is implemented)

## Team Roles

*   Project Manager: (You)
*   Developer(s): (You, potentially freelancers/contractors)
*   UI/UX Designer: (You, potentially freelancers/contractors)
*   Content Creators/Editors: (You, vetted users, potentially paid contributors)
*   Testers: (You, users)

## Risk Management

*   **Lack of user adoption:** Implement marketing strategies.
*   **Content quality issues:** Implement content review processes.
*   **Technical issues:** Thorough testing and ongoing maintenance.
*   **Scalability challenges:** Performance optimization is critical. We may need to limit features.
*   **Security vulnerabilities:** Follow secure coding practices and keep software up to date.
*   **Performance bottlenecks:** Careful code optimization (React and PHP), database optimization, and potentially caching are essential.
