# Landing Page
#process/validation #marketing

A simple web page created during Phase 0 of the [[MVP (Minimum Viable Product)]] development.

**Purpose:**
*   Describe the value proposition of NotesVault specifically for the target niche ([[B.Sc Biotechnology, MGM Nanded]]).
*   Gauge initial interest by collecting email sign-ups from potential early adopters *before* significant development effort.
*   Provides a list of interested users for Alpha/Beta testing.

**Implementation:**
*   A basic static HTML page (`landing_page.html`) was created initially.
*   Needs a mechanism to actually collect/store email signups (e.g., simple form handler, third-party service free tier).
