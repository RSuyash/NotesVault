#tools/notes #requirement/output

A popular knowledge base and note-taking application that works on local [[Markdown]] files.

**Relevance to NotesVault:**
*   The target output format for the [[Document Generator]] in the [[MVP (Minimum Viable Product)]] is **Obsidian-compatible Markdown**.
*   This implies using standard Markdown syntax, potentially including [[wikilinks]] (`[[Page Name]]`) and `#tags` for better organization and graph visualization within Obsidian.
*   Features like [[Knowledge Graph]] are inspired by Obsidian's graph view.
