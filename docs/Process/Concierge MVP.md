# Concierge MVP
#process/validation #process/lean

An optional but recommended validation technique suggested for Phase 0 of the NotesVault [[MVP (Minimum Viable Product)]].

**Concept:**
*   Instead of building the full automated system first, manually (or semi-manually) fulfill the core promise for the first few interested users (from the [[Landing Page]] signups).
*   In this case: Take a relevant [[B.Sc Biotechnology, MGM Nanded]] topic, manually use [[Google AI Studio]] (or similar) to generate notes, format them into [[Obsidian]]-compatible [[Markdown]], and deliver them to the user.

**Purpose:**
*   Gather deep qualitative feedback on the *desired output* (format, structure, quality, usefulness) with minimal development effort.
*   Test the core value proposition directly with the target niche.
*   Inform prompt engineering for the automated [[Document Generator]].
